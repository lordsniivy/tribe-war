## Tribe War! ##

#

You are a Red Scale, a tribe of Dragons that dwell in mountainous regions.
It is your duty as a soldier to defend your homeland. Your enemies, the
Shimmer Tails, have made it their mission to gain more land by any
means necessary. The Red Dawn territory is their target, and you are the only
one left to defend the Northern Front.

Good luck!
